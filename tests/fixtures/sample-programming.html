            <h2>What is JavaScript?</h2>
            <p>
                JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language that is one of the core
                technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. It enables interactive
                web pages and is an essential part of web applications. JavaScript is a versatile
                language that can be used for both client-side and server-side development.

            <h2>Key Features of JavaScript</h2>
            <p>
                JavaScript supports object-oriented, imperative, and functional programming styles.
                It has dynamic typing, first-class functions, and prototype-based object orientation.
                Modern JavaScript includes features like arrow functions, promises, async/await,
                classes, modules, and destructuring.

            <h2>JavaScript in Web Development</h2>
            <p>
                JavaScript is primarily used to create interactive effects within web browsers.
                Developers use JavaScript frameworks and libraries like React, Vue, Angular, and
                Node.js to build complex applications. The language has evolved significantly
                with ECMAScript standards, introducing modern syntax and powerful features that
                make development more efficient and enjoyable.

            <h2>Learning JavaScript</h2>
            <p>
                To become proficient in JavaScript, developers should understand variables,
                data types, functions, control structures, objects, arrays, and the Document
                Object Model (DOM). Practice with coding exercises, building projects, and
                reading documentation helps solidify these concepts. Modern developers also
                need to understand asynchronous programming, event handling, and how to work
                with APIs.
